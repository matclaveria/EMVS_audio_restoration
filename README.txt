Results for Expectation-maximisation for variable selection in audio restoration.

-Folder results denoising_1 contains audible results of the denoising experiment of Section IV.1
 (short instrument/timbre excerpts)
-Folder results denoising_2 contains audible results of the denoising experiment of Section IV.2
 (long polyphonic excerpt).
-Folder results missing_data contains audible results for the experiment of Section IV.3
 (short glockenspiel excerpt and long trumpet recording).

When the results reported results have been obtained by averaging over many realisations 
of the experiment (section IV.3), a single sample has been randomly selected to exemplify 
the performance of the algorithm. The complete data set can be accessed by request.
